# Rharana Streaming Service
This project allows you to set a folder in your server's file system, and directly stream your own media from it.

Although as of today, it will be required to add an API entry to each media resting on your file system that you want to display.
Currently its main function and interest is being able to chromecast to your TV any media you have on your computer, but when
it breaks into production it will be possible to access all your media from the internet via IP whitelist.

Designed for private use, but completely open source, extract from it and inspire yourself to make your own personal home
server. 

This project exists merely to display my personal experience in MERN stack an will keep on growing and changing for as
long as its development is interesting. 

### Undocumented, uncomplete and messy:

You're goddamn right Jesse, this documentation is not complete, not instructional, not clear and irrelevant.
I really encourage you to follow this project because this is completely unfair and outrageous and will be
fixed ASAP: including creating an API chart to understand backend, commands, .nvm documentation an more!
The project is not yet ready to be understood by anybody except myself and it is a shame, so stay tuned for future updates!
I'm currently enhancing my MERN skills and everything is going to change very, very soon...

### Disclaimer:
Any media displayed in this document resident on my own iteration of the server is NOT by any means downloaded via piracy
and the project's intention is very far from atracting people to pirate and display illegal movies. I do not declare
responsible for fraudulent use of this repository's content nor do i support piracy.
